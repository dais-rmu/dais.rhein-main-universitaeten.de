Network flows over time are a fascinating generalization of classical (static) network flows, introducing an element of time. They naturally model problems where travel and transmission are not instantaneous and flow may vary over time. Not surprisingly, flow over time problems turn out to be more challenging to solve than their static counterparts. In this talk, we mainly focus on the efficient computation of transshipments over time in networks with several source and sink nodes with given supplies and demands, which is arguably the most difficult flow over time problem that can still be solved in polynomial time.
