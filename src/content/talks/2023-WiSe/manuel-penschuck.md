Random graphs are commonly used as network models and, as such, often capture typical features shared amongst graphs from some (application) domain. In algorithmics, we can use such models to improve our theoretical understanding of the practical performance of graph algorithms, e.g., by encoding input classes for average case analyses as random graphs.

Especially in the algorithm engineering community, random graphs additionally gained attention as a controllable and versatile data source for experimental campaigns. However, generating such data-sets at scale is a non-trivial task in itself.

In this talk, we introduce a selection of basic algorithmic techniques used in practical graph generators and highlight how the presumed model of computation informs the design of state-of-the-art generators. Most ideas are also applicable to sample discrete objects beyond random graphs.
