Many real-world problems are treated sequentially. One prominent example
for such a sequential process is public transport optimization:
One starts with network design, then plans lines and their
frequencies. Based on these, the timetable is determined,
and later on the vehicles’ and drivers’ schedules. The goal is to
transport passengers according to their needs efficiently.

The sequential procedure sketched above can be regarded as a
Greedy approach: in each planning stage one aims at the best one can
do. This usually leads to suboptimal solutions. On the other hand,
in public transport optimization, the single steps
are already NP hard such that solving the
integrated problem to optimality seems to be out of scope.

We introduce and analyze the price of sequentiality which measures
how much can be gained by integrated approaches. We present
different approaches for integrated optimization and illustrate them
for the case of public
transport optimization. Among them is the Eigenmodel as a framework for
(heuristic) integrated approaches.
We conclude with algorithmic challenges towards sustainable mobility.
