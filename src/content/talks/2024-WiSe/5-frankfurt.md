Assuming P ≠ NP, the worst case runtime for any algorithm solving an NP-hard must be super-polynomial. But what is the lowest runtime we can get? Before one can even hope to approach this question, a more provoking one presents itself: Since for many problems simple "brain-dead" algorithms are still the fastest known, maybe these are already optimal? In this survey talk we give three examples of research lines studying this type of question for the Traveling Salesperson Problem, the Set Cover problem, and (if time permits) a classical scheduling problem with precedence constraints.
