In the broadcasting problem on trees, a {0,1}-message, originating in an
unknown node, is passed along the tree with a certain error probability q. The goal is to estimate the original
message without knowing the order in which the nodes were informed. A
variation of the problem is considering this broadcasting process on a randomly
growing tree, which Addario-Berry et al. have investigated for uniformly recursive and linear preferential
attachment trees. We extend their studies to the entire group of very simple
increasing trees, as well as shape exchangeable trees, using the
connection between them and other stochastic processes with memory effects.
