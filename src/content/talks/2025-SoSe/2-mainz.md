Many classical pivot rules used in the simplex algorithm fall into the class of normalized-weight pivot rules. For a fixed normalization, the collection of normalized-weight pivot rules on a given linear program forms a polyhedral space, whose geometry is captured by a pivot rule polytope.  This talk introduces the framework of normalized-weight pivot rules and their associated polytopes, highlighting their applications beyond optimization. This is joint work with Alex Black, Jesus De Loera, and Niklas Lütjeharms.
