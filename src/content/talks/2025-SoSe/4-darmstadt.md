Twin-width is a recently introduced graph parameter that has shown remarkable utility in algorithmic and structural graph theory, most notably because first-order model checking becomes tractable when graphs are given with witnesses of small twin-width. While many graph classes are known to have bounded twin-width, understanding the behavior of this parameter on specific families of graphs remains challenging, particularly in the sparse setting.

In this talk, we will explore twin-width through three interconnected themes. First, we present new bounds relating the twin-width of a graph to tree-like structural decompositions. Concretely, we show that the twin-width of a graph is linearly bounded in both its strong tree-width and the twin-width of its biconnected components, with extensions to higher connectivity.

Secondly, we examine the role of symmetry in bounded-degree graphs, proving that extremal graphs of high twin-width and bounded degree must be asymmetric—a sharp contrast to dense extremal examples like Paley and Rook's graphs. This asymmetry requirement partly explains the difficulty in constructing explicit cubic graphs of large twin-width. Indeed, no explicit cubic graph of twin-width greater than 4 is currently known, despite cubic graphs having unbounded twin-width.

Finally, we investigate strongly regular graphs where, surprisingly, the twin-width coincides with a natural lower bound on many graph families. We add new families of strongly regular graphs to this list, but conjecture that these well-behaved families are the exception rather than the norm.
