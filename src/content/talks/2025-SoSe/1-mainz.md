Let $A$ be an $n x m$ integer matrix with components  bounded by $Δ$ in absolute value. Cook et al. (1986) have shown that there exists a universal matrix $B ∈ ℤ^{m' ×n}$ such that, for each $b$, the integer hull of $Ax≤b$ is described by  $Bx ≤t$ for some $t$. In this talk we will show that $t$ is an affine function of $b$ as long as $b$ is from a fixed equivalence class of the lattice $D ⋅ ℤ^m$. This makes the result applicable in some FPT-settings. An application is the resolution of an open problem posed by Cslovjecsek et al. (SODA 2024) concerning the complexity of 2-stage-stochastic integer programming problems.
