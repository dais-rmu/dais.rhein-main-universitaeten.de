In this talk, I will present recent advances in exploiting combinatorial symmetry to improve the performance of practical algorithms. In particular, I will highlight recent developments in the algorithms computing the symmetries of combinatorial objects. Then, I will discuss how to effectively make use of symmetry in modern SAT solving.
