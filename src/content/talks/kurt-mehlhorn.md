A set of indivisible goods, e.g., a car, a house, a toothbrush, ..., has to be split among a set of agents in a _fair manner_. Each agent has its own valuation function for sets of goods. What constitutes a fair allocation? When does a fair allocation exist? If it exists, can we compute it efficiently? Can we approximate fair allocations?

The talk is based on joint work with H. Akrami, N.Alon, B. Chaudhury, J. Garg, M. Hoefer, T. Kavitha, R. Mehta, P. Misra, M. Schmalhofer, A. Sgouritsa, G. Shahkarami, G. Varricchio, Q. Vermande, and E. van Wijland that appeared in EC20, EC21, EC23, JACM 23, FSTTCS 20, SODA 21, AAAI 22, IJCAI 23, and SICOMP 22.
