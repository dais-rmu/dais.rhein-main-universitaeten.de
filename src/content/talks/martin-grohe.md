Graph neural networks (GNNs) are deep learning models for graph data
that play a key role in machine learning on graphs. A GNN describes a
distributed algorithm carrying out local computations at the vertices of
the input graph. Typically, the parameters governing this algorithm are
acquired through data-driven learning processes.

After introducing the basic model, in this talk we will focus on the
expressiveness of GNNs: which functions on graphs or their vertices can
be computed by GNNs? An intriguing and nontrivial facet of this inquiry
is that GNNs are “analog” computation models operating on and with real
numbers. Nevertheless, we can give precise characterisations of the
expressiveness of GNNs in terms of Boolean circuits and logic, that is,
computation models of classical (descriptive) complexity theory.
