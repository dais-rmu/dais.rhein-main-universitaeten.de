A probabilistic approach to the analysis of algorithms is discussed focussing on very simple but fundamental discrete algorithmic tasks. Examples are shown where stochastic processes are used (and needed) for a refined description of the algorithms' complexities. In particular, partial match queries and an algorithm for selecting ranks within data are discussed.
