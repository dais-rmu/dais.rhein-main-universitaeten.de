Random greedy algorithms are simple to describe but often surprisingly hard to understand. In this talk, I will discuss a random process for constructing graphs that avoid a given pattern F: starting from a complete graph, we repeatedly and randomly remove copies of a fixed graph or hypergraph F.

Until now, this process had been well understood only when F is a triangle. I will present new results that extend this understanding to a wide class of graphs and hypergraphs with mild regularity properties, providing a unified picture of how these random removal processes evolve.

This is joint work with Marcus Kühn.
