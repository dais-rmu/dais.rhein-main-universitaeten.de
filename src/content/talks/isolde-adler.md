Property testing (for a property P) asks for a given graph, whether it has
property P, or is "structurally far" from having that property. A "testing
algorithm" is a probabilistic algorithm that answers this question with
high probability correctly, by only looking at small parts of the input. 
Testing algorithms are thought of as "extremely efficient", making them relevant in the context of large data sets.

In this talk I will present recent positive and negative results about
testability of properties definable in first-order logic and monadic second-order
logic on classes of bounded-degree graphs.

This is joint work with Polly Fahey, Frederik Harwath, Noleen KÃ¶hler and Pan Peng.
